# ChronoRoot 2.0 - Standard Root Phenotyping Interface

This directory contains the Standard Root Phenotyping Interface for ChronoRoot 2.0, designed for detailed architectural analysis of individual plant root systems.

![Figure](Screenshots/MainInterface.png)

## Overview

The Standard Interface maintains continuity with the original ChronoRoot system while adding modern visualization capabilities and enhanced analysis methods. It provides tools for precise measurement of root system architecture (RSA) parameters and growth patterns through a graph-based representation approach.

## Key Features

- Detailed RSA analysis through graph-based representation
- Temporal tracking of root development
- Real-time visualization of segmentation results
- Comprehensive statistical analysis of growth patterns
- Automated report generation
- Export in Root System Markup Language (RSML) format

## Measurements Provided

The Standard Interface provides the following measurements:

### Basic Architecture
- Main Root (MR) Length
- Lateral Root (LR) Length
- Total Root (TR) Length
- Number of Lateral Roots
- Discrete LR Density
- Main Over Total Root ratio

### Growth Analysis
- Growth Speed
- Fourier Components

### Spatial Distribution

## Usage

### Starting the Interface

```bash
conda activate ChronoRootInterface
python run.py
```

## Integration with Segmentation

This interface works with segmentation masks produced by the nnUNet module in `segmentationApp/`. For best results, ensure that videos are properly segmented before analysis.
